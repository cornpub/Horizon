"The soft sound of ocean waves gently lulling back and forth is the first thing I remember."
"The next thing I remembered was the soft, warm, and bright rays of sunshine on my face, waking me from my gentle sleep."
"That's about all I could remember. Besides that, my mind was clear, I couldn't recall my age, name, or anything like that."
"\"Where am I? What is this place?\""
"My eyes slowly opened and greeted the bedroom I was in."
"\"Oh, this is…\""
"Not a place I was familiar with."
"Everything here was foreign to me... but I was overcome with a strange feeling of Deja Vu, like I've been here before."
"\"Who am I? Why can't I remember a single thing? Where is this place?\""
"I pointed at the window in front of me."
"\"Well, clearly that's a window, and those are curtains over the edges.\""
"Next, I pointed at the wall."
"That's a poster for some kind of rock band."
"How come I knew what everything in this room was, yet nothing about myself?"
"I know what these things are, but I still can't remember where they come from..."
"I couldn't put this feeling into words. It was like when you got lost in the woods, where you knew that there were trees everywhere, but you still couldn't figure your way out."
"I didn't even know what I looked like. Maybe I had dark hair, maybe it was light."
"Maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration, maybe I was just a bit in shock."
"I focused as hard as I could, trying to muster up a single ounce of knowledge about myself."
"..."
"Nope, nothing."
"Well, I guess I can at least figure out my hair color."
"I pulled down my hair, which although was short, was enough to meet my eye level."
"..."
"Well, turns out I have brown hair. Guess that's at least a place to start."
"I glanced across from my bed, and noticed a mirror hanging on the wall next to the closet."
"Curious to see what I looked like, I slowly lifted myself out of bed, my muscles stiff like I just woke up from a deep sleep."
"..."
"Well, I guess this is what I look like."
"I was greeted by emerald eyes, dark skin, and brown hair. I don't really know what I expected, but it sort of surprised me to see how plain I looked."
"I just looked like any average guy that you might run into on the street."
"I felt like an outsider looking through someone else's eyes through this mirror, like this body wasn't mine."
"I mean, clearly, this was my face. After all, I'm looking at it, aren't I?"
"Still, I felt like a stranger, as I had no idea who this person I was looking at was. Was he a nice guy? Or was he a criminal?"
"Thinking about who I truly was made me a bit light-headed and dizzy, so I decided to stop. Instead, I tried to think about where I was."
"\"What's outside the bedroom? Where am I?\""
"I asked the question out loud, like I was waiting for someone to answer me."
"..."
"There was no answer."
"All there came was the sound of the ocean waves gently pulling and pushing, gently echoing against the walls of my room."
"Well, I can at least say, I am as clueless about this place as I was about myself."
"It's almost like I was a character from a video game, TV show, or something like that."
"It's almost script perfect actually."
"Step one: wake up in a foreign land. Check."
"Step two: have amnesia. Check."
"Step three: get magic powers, and find a hot girl. Uh… not check."
"I felt more like an NPC, or a side character at the moment, rather than being the charming and daring protagonist."
"You know… speaking of being a side character…"
"Where is everyone else? Maybe someone here knows about me, and could lend me a hand or two."
"You know… this place is starting to have a musty smell to it. It's getting hard to breathe, I don't want to stick around for long."
